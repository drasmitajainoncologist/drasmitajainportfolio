Create a complete, modern, premium **Doctor Portfolio Website UI designed specifically as a React application**.

The design should be **component-based, reusable, responsive, accessible, and developer-friendly**, with a clear visual system that can be translated directly into React components.

The website is for an experienced specialist doctor and should communicate **medical expertise, trust, professionalism, compassion, credibility and easy appointment booking**.

Do not design it like a hospital dashboard or medical SaaS product. It should feel like a **premium personal professional website for a doctor**.
